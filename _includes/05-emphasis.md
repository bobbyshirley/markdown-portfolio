## GAIN THESE 10 SKILLS TO SUCCEED AT ANY JOB

Specialized skills help you stand out amongst job applicants, but they aren’t the only skills that employers seek. There are many transferable soft skills that are sure to come in handy throughout your career. From professional communication to emotional intelligence, here are just ten of the abilities that make you an invaluable asset in the workplace.

## Professional Communication

Whether you are speaking with your coworkers via email, phone, or video call, what you say — *and how you say it* — matters.

You may have heard that potential employers begin interviewing you the moment you contact them. If you are unable to clearly express yourself via email, they may question whether or not you will be able to express yourself in the office.

Remember to greet the recipient(s) of your email by name and close professionally (“Thanks” and “Cheers” are great options).

**In general, speak clearly and be concise. And most importantly, if you need to ask a question for clarification, go for it!**

## Organization

Organization skills begin with a decision to clean up and clear out. To avoid the dreaded “Did you get my email?” message, you might have to consider the unthinkable: folders. Create folders for certain people and/or projects. Create folders for the product ads that you may find useful at a later date. And by all means, move those junk messages to your spam folder.

Another great organization tactic is to keep lists of your in-progress and upcoming projects. You should never have to ask yourself, What am I supposed to be doing?

Use a calendar app (or two) to keep track of important dates and deadlines so that you can focus on one task at a time (but don’t forget to set reminders!). You can also turn off distracting notifications from social media apps.

Finally, keep your desk as organized as possible. The pile of papers next to your laptop makes you look busy, which, unfortunately, is not the same as being productive. Keep your space clear and your mind focused on the task at hand.

## Learning

Technology is changing every day. The skills that were impressive just a few years ago are now, sadly, outdated. The ability to recognize when updated or new skills are required is invaluable in any career.

Are you a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learner? Knowing this can help you pick up skills in a uniquely efficient way.


## Sales

You don’t have to work in the sales department to hone your sales skills. In fact, the ability to sell comes in handy in virtually every career on the planet.

Do you know your product? Can you use it well enough to teach someone else how it works? 

Another invaluable sales skill is the ability to speak clearly and empathetically. You're not a robot, don't act like one!

Finally, become a great listener. 

## Emotional Intelligence

Emotional intelligence is not an easy skill to hone, but once you can use it, you will instantly become more valuable as an employee (and improve the overall quality of your life!). This form of intelligence requires that you recognize not just your own emotions but the emotions of your coworkers and customers as well.

Always take a moment to pause before commenting or asking questions. Learn from constructive criticism, no matter how harsh it may seem. And as I mentioned before, be your authentic self and show empathy.

When giving feedback, use the “*compliment sandwich.*” Deliver your suggestion/criticism between two compliments. This makes it easier for people to accept your thoughts without making them feel underappreciated.

## Keep Your Commitments

**“To be on time is to be late. To be early is to be on time.”**  

Consistently showing up early for meetings sends an important signal: you’re reliable. If you plan to be early and then life (bad hair day, traffic, etc.) happens, you still have the potential to show up on time.

Keep an eye on the clock. **You got this.**

## Flexibility

You know how it goes: You’re working on a project that requires your full attention. You’ve gotten into a rhythm, and there’s no stopping you now.

*And then your phone rings or you get a text.*

The ability to go with the flow without compromising quality is invaluable in any career. As long as there are plans, there will be a wrench to mess them up. But as long as you can stay flexible, you can keep working.

Rall with the punches, remember that you are only human and not Superman, or SuperWoman. You can do only what you can do. Stay positive and get stuff done!

## Time Management

Prioritizing your daily tasks is the most important task when you’re wanting to manage your time more efficiently. Simply checking your email at specific times can get rid wasted times and unneeded stress.

Now, time to talk about social media...

Finally, don’t skip your lunch break. While it may seem liek a good idea to be able to power through and get more work done, it can hinder your effectiveness later in the day. Treat yourself to dessert and be thankful for 30 minutes of “down” time!

## Be a Team Player

Are you able to work well in groups and on teams? Yes? Congratulations! You possess a skill that employers value and that few people can claim.

Cooperation and appreciation of ideas are keys to being happier in a team environment. But don’t let this stop you from taking on a leadership role when appropriate. By exhibiting confidence in your own abilities, your team members will be inspired to do the same. Soon, the team will be running like a finely-tuned machine, with each person focusing on the tasks that are best suited to him/her.

## Grace Under Pressure

Finally, any career will require you to handle deadlines, crises, and stress with grace. Do your best work… even when you feel like you're drowning. The ability to reframe less desirable tasks into a challenge to be accomplished may help you get by. By keeping positive in the midst of the proverbial storm, you’ll remain connected to your inner joy. And if you can do that, you win.
